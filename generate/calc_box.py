This script is used to calculate the diagonal length of the bounding boxes
of each object, the diagonal length will be used to control the camera distance
in generate.py, the calculated length and object path will be saved to "diameters.txt"
This script cannot be used inside generate.py unless the 'vedo' package is installed in Blender
